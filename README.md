## About
so_long is a project at 42 with the goal to create a really simple game. It is about learning how to use windows, events, colours and more.
The school provides a small library to use which only contains some really basic functions. 

**how to use:**

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/JeremieSiller/so_long/
```
run make to compile the programm 
```bash
make
```
execute the programm with a .ber file
```bash
./so_long map.ber
```
to start the game the map file needs to follow some rules else it will just return an error. (For more information look into [Description](#description))


## Description
**how to play:**
- use W A S D to move
- collect all coins before going to the spaceship
- if you try to fly away with the spaceship without collecting all coins you loose
- press ESC or click the red cross to exit the window and the program

**a valid map...**
- is sorrounded by walls (1)
- contains at least one exit (E)
- contains at least one coin (C)
- contains exactly one player (P)
