## About
so_long is a project at 42 with the goal to create a really simple game. It is about learning how to use windows, events, colours and more.
The school provides a small library to use which only contains some really basic functions. 

**how to use:**

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayeCaptainJack/so_long/
```
run make to compile the programm 
```bash
make
```
execute the programm with a .ber file
```bash
./so_long map.ber
```
to start the game the map file needs to follow some rules else it will just return an error. (For more information look into [Description](#description))
